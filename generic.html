								<h3></h3>
								<p> Hello! My name is Owen. I am a software developer based in Chicago, IL.

									<br>I have a love and passion for all things creative. I especially enjoy creating things that live on the internet. Whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.</br>
                  <br>
									I studied at Northern Illinois University majoring in Biology. Shortly after finishing my studies, the three adults in my life fell ill and were hospitalized. I immediately switched gears and became a full-time caretaker. During this time, I would spend the day making sure my family, especially my grandfather, received the best medical care they needed. 

									Most people leave university unsure of what their next plans are. It’s an exciting time of discovery and exploration. For me, I was not afforded this luxury and spent every waking hour caretaking. Although my story is unconventional, I did make that ‘discovery’ when I walked into a Barns & Noble and found a book on “how to code in Python”. It intrigued me and I could not put it down. This would lead me down a path of discovering that I love coding and building things. And so every night, when my day was done, I would crack open books and learn to code. 
									
									I did this everyday with the dream of becoming a full stack developer. I also found a passion for the sneaker culture and started a small resell business. Sneakers became my creative outlet in more ways than one.
									
									In between learning how to code. I made a ton of friends along the way and eventually those friends would help me transition into my new role as a technical support specialist at a payment gateway company based in Chicago. 
									
									My experiences in caretaking, and also in technical support has taught me much about being organized, attention to detail, and problem solving. As a software developer I utilize these skills to build web applications that meets the needs of users.
